# Kickstarting with Excel
https://github.com/AKumar1-lab/kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Advanced Excel data analysis on Kickstarter dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends and success rates. 

### Purpose
Using features in Excel that uses pivot tables, pivot charts, filtering and formatting, statistical analysis and advanced data visualization to present the data.  The advanced data analysis and visualization sets the basic stage for advanced data visualization using other Excel skills such as VBA Macros and analysis.

## Analysis and Challenges
There were no anticipated challenges during the analysis or preparation of the files.  As I have been working with data and converting to pivot tables.  What I did not know was that I can use a pivot chart based on my pivot table.  This will make work a lot easier for presentation.  I did have a slight challenge with the countifs formula.  Eventually I was able to work on the chart below “Outcomes based on Goal”.

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges that were encountered were the CountIfs formula, the pivot chart colors were slightly different, and uploading documents into GitHub repository for the first time.
## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The conclusions that I can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on the Launch date.  Most of the projects were successful, slightly over 100%, in the month of May.  The failure of projects occurred in October slightly over 50%
The second conclusion that is drawn, is that the parent category is based on all theater, however that also includes subcategories in plays, music, and spaces.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
For every successful pro, there was a slight inverse of failed projects based on each increment in the goal amount.  It was also noted that there were more successful projects when the goal amount was $10,000 or less. The outcomes are based on goals only for the subcategory plays.
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are some factors such as exchange rates that have not been accounted for as it appears that there are many countries that are included.  It is an assumption that the dollars are converted to U.S dollars.
Not all parent categories have a subcategory or all three “successful”, “failed”, and “canceled” outcomes.  Therefore, this will need to be streamlined, either by restricting or expanding to ensure that all three outcomes are included.  
The term “successful” is indetermined, as we do not know what the criteria is for a successful outcome, there are many unknowns such as media, advertising, longevity of the program, marketing team, better management.
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Possible tables and/or graphs that would be created are:
- to compare the data for the number of plays in the U.S. vs. other countries.  This would be to see where the viable market is.
- to see if there is a trend between the dollars pledged and the number of backers to see the correlation between a successful or failed outcome.
- Since most of the successful outcomes occurred in May, it may be interesting to see if the initiation date and end date made a difference in the number of backers received during this month.
-It would also be nice to include a graph with the Theater outcomes by launch date and include the subcategory of plays.  This would provide better decision making on what months the plays were successful.
